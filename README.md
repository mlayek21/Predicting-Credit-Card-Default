# Credit Card Default Prediction using a Neural Network

Predicting credit card defaults is an important task for credit card companies, as it helps them identify customers who are at risk of defaulting and take steps to mitigate this risk. In this project, we demonstrate how to use a neural network to make credit card default predictions.

## Data Preparation

The first step in our process is to gather and prepare the data that we will use to train and test our model. This data may come from credit reports, credit card transactions, and other sources, and may include information about customer demographics, credit card usage, and payment history. We will need to clean and preprocess this data to ensure that it is ready for use in our model.

## Model Architecture

Next, we will define the architecture of our neural network. This will involve deciding on the number of layers, the number of nodes in each layer, and the type of activation functions to use. We will also need to choose an optimizer and a loss function for training the model.

## Model Training

With the model architecture defined, we can begin training the model using our prepared data. This will involve feeding the data through the model, adjusting the weights and biases of the model to minimize the loss function, and repeating this process until the model converges.

## Model Testing

After training the model, we will need to evaluate its performance on a test set of data to see how accurately it can predict credit card defaults. We may need to fine-tune the model by adjusting the hyperparameters or adding additional layers to improve its performance.

## Deployment

Once we are satisfied with the performance of our model, we can deploy it for use in predicting credit card defaults. This may involve integrating the model into a larger system or making it available as a standalone tool. We can then use the model to predict the risk of default for new customers, helping credit card companies to make informed decisions about granting credit.

## Role of Neural Network

The neural network in this project is responsible for analyzing patterns in credit card usage and customer demographic data to identify trends that are indicative of a high risk of default. By training the model on a large dataset of credit card transactions and customer information, the neural network is able to learn complex relationships between these variables that might be difficult for a human analyst to identify. Once deployed, the model can be used to make predictions about the risk of default for new customers, helping credit card companies to mitigate risk and maintain the stability of their business.
